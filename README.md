# My Simple Python App

A small Python project to practice modular programming and Git/GitHub workflow.  
This project demonstrates the use of multiple Python files, functions, and a simple main script.

## 📂 Project Structure

## ⚙️ Features

- Prints a welcome message
- Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition and multiplication)
- Demonstrates modular Python code with multiple files
- Easy to extend with new modules or functions

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Navigate to the project folder in the terminal:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/myproject
    ```
3. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

You should see output like:

=====================
My Simple Python App
Hello, Ahmed! Welcome to the Python app.
Addition: 5 + 3 = 8
Multiplication: 4 * 7 = 28

## 🛠️ Files

- `main.py` – Entry point for the program
- `calculator.py` – Functions for arithmetic operations
- `greetings.py` – Functions for printing greetings
- `my_utils.py` – Helper functions for formatting output

## 💡 Tips

- Keep commits small and descriptive when using Git.
- You can add new modules and import them in `main.py`.
- Rename files carefully to avoid conflicts with Python packages.
